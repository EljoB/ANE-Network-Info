# AirNetworkInfo
AirNetworkInfo is an ADOBE AIR Native Extension (ANE) to test if the current device has an active connection.
It works both for iOS and Android devices.


# Use
Call the function AirNetworkInfo.networkInfo.isConnected() to check the current status of the device.
For Android devices, you need to enable the following permissions:
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
in order to make it work (otherwise the returned state will always be not connected).


# Installation
The ANE is already compiled. You can find under the folder Binaries. 
If you want to recompile it, just run ant in the same directory, after changing the parameters (called properties) in build.xml.

# IOS Compilation
The iOS library has been compiled using the sdk iOS 4.3 and deployment target set to iOS 4.0, using GCC 4.2.
This ANE has NOT been tested with an sdk version superior to iOS 4.3.
